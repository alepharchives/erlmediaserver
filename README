Required software

To use the erlmediaserver you have to install yaws in your enviroment. In the Makefile there is the path to the yaws installation included.

How does things work together

After starting the erlmediaserver, a yaws webserver will be avaiable under the current ip address on port 5001. 
Also ssdp is started. This is the server which send the alive message via multicast 1900. The ssdp will also receive messages from upnp client on this port. 

When the server is started and you know the ip you can enter the URL http://<IP>:5001/description/fetch and you will see the description of the server

NOTE: The server only works on MAC OS, because i used sw_vers to detect the OS infos. I will fix this immediately!!!
