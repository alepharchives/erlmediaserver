	Required. Multicast channel and port reserved for SSDP by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Must be 
	239.255.255.250:1900. If the port number (“:1900”) is omitted, the receiver should assume the default SSDP port 
	number of 1900.

CACHE-CONTROL  
	Required. Must have max-age directive that specifies number of seconds the advertisement is valid. After this duration, 
	control points should assume the device (or service) is no longer available. Should be greater than or equal to 1800 
	seconds (30 minutes). Specified by UPnP vendor. Integer.
	   
LOCATION

SERVER  
	Required. Concatenation of OS name, OS version, UPnP/1.0, product name, and product version. Specified by UPnP 
	vendor. String. Must accurately reflect the version number of the UPnP Device Architecture supported by the device. 
	Control points must be prepared to accept a higher minor version number than the control point itself implements. For 
	example, control points implementing UDA version 1.0 will be able to interoperate with devices implementing UDA 
	version 1.1. 

USN  
	Required. Unique Service Name. Identifies a unique instance of a device or service. Must be one of the following. (cf. 
	table above.) The prefix (before the double colon) must match the value of the UDN element in the device description.

		type. 
	uuid:device-UUID::urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:serviceType:v  
		Sent once for every service. Device UUID specified by UPnP vendor. Service type and version defined by UPnP 
		Forum working committee. Specifies the highest support version of the service type.
